# Orion 10" dob
1200mm focal length  
254mm aperature  
Focal ratio: f4.7 (1200/254)
Max useful magnifiction:  2x254mm ~500x.  Seeing will definitly limit that.
Mag = focal length / eyepiece mm.
So for 32mm nagler, it's 37x.

# HQ cam chip specs
6.287mm x 4.712mm (7.9mm diagonal)

# prime focus FOV
see http://www.johnrcrilly.com/LX200-14/FOV.pdf  

ONLY based on focal length of telescope and dimensions of ccd chip. 

decent approximation:  chip_mm * (3000 / telescope_fl)
So for the dob, it's 7.9mm * 3000 / 1200 or ~17 arc minutes.
Note the moon is about half a degree big, so that's 30 arc minutes.
This means prime focus will give me about *half* the moon...and may give
decent planets.

My math:  jupiter is around 50 arcseconds...so just under an arc minute.  That's 1/17 of our total FOV.
I think inserting a 2x barlow will double that.

Saturn is currently 18.3 arcseconds...about 1/3 of an arc-minute.   May be too small for prime focus.
