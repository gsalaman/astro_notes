# Using 4x powermate on TV-85

Still haven't tried this on astro to see if it's viable, but in daytime tests, this is what worked:

* Need filter wheel on scope first (for extra extension!)...use screw-in adapter.
* Then goes the 2" extender
* Then the powermate
* THEN the ZWO533MC....and note it's out about on the second ring.

Focus point is racked almost all the way in.

Also note that exposure times needed to be upped significantly!  I needed 5x more in daytime.
