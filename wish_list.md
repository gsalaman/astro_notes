# Wish List
Current prios:
1) get EQ platform going!
2) Upgrade focuser on 10"
3) New Astro cam for Ha with some sort of laptop.

## Mount
Sky-tracker does well.  Camera only config is great.  Celetron is under weight-limit, but putting on the TV-85 puts it RIGHT at limit.
Haven't tried serious tracking, but conventional wisdom is that for astrophotography, you want to be running at HALF weight limit.

So, put on the wishlist a new mount.    
For the TV-85, you'd want ~23 lb capacity.
If I wanted to someday upgrade to a TV-127, you are adding just under 10 lbs, which means you want to go with something 50lbs...and you aren't getting focal length/mag.

Sooo....this is longer term...if you want that kind of mag with aperature, you probably want to go with some sort of a Reichy-Cerrian or SCT. 

Or, if the goal is just mag for planets, I should really get the EQ platform going on the 10" dob.  Tracking isn't gonna be as great as polar alignemnt will be off some,
but I say do it and then try...

## Camera
So, the Canon DLSR has an internal IR filter...meaning we don't get the Ha line.  You can go dedicated...good sweet spot here is in the $1k range, but those all require WINDOWS PCs to drive them.  :(

## Focus!
Should upgrade focusers on the 10" and 12".  Probably start with the 10".
Orion's dedicated one is a safe bet, but it's continously back-ordered.  Maybe look at a better focuser?

## Planet Mag
So if I stick with the TV-85, I only get 1.35 arc-seconds per pixel.  This means:
* Jupiter:  60 arc seconds = 44 pixels
* Saturn:  20 arc seconds = 15 pixels

So, if I want to keep on this route, the right answer may be a powermate.  Need to do math to make sure the focus path isn't extended a bunch (the 2x barlow puts focus spot WAY outside focuser range).
