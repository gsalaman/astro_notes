# Dawson's Celestron

Checked out Dawson's Celestron scope for David...the remote isn't working.  Preliminary analysis:
* You can still move the scope via the remote
* The screen is iffy at best...most of the time, you can't get any characters to show up
* Optics, however, are decent

My next steps:  can we either fix or replace the remote, or get the RS-232 connecton on the bottom to work for tracking.

## Further Research
Turns out, you can't buy replacement for this beast.  It's a Nextar8, circa 2000.  Check out this link from cloudy nights:

I tried the ribbon cable repair, cleaning it with electronics cleaner.  No noticable improvement.

Probed the serial connections...pinouts can be found here:

Turns out you'll need to enable RS-232 every time, which means knowing the menu.  A newer menu tree is on this site, but the old menus aren't documented.

Couldn't get the screen on reliably to navigate the menu.
