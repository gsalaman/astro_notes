# Combining color channels in Photoshop

I'm starting with a stacked Oiii and Ha image of the veil nebula.  Already curve adjusted....didn't use the upscaled ones for this.

First step is to align the two images.  
Open both separately in photoshop, then pick one to paste into the other.  
Do a transformation to align (turning down the top layer's opacity), and then crop and save the combined image (so that you can use the two layers as starting points for the color channel combine.

Method #1:
Make the Ha layer the top layer.  Turn down the opacity, then go into levels and do a standard level adjustment to bring out the reds (I did just RGB)
