Okay, wanna see if I can get dawson's Nexstar 8 on the iOptron mount to do planetary.  From the optics calcs, I should be about to get about 5 pixels per arc-second..and then throw in tracking and the ASI studio "grab a crap-ton-of-pics"...and I should have my planetary game WAAAAY upped.

First, removing the top from the tripod:  3 big "thumb-screws"...and then a 5mm allen in the center.  All that stuff is in the barn.

Next, getting the OTA off the fork-arm.  see this:

Internal screws were 1.5 mm allen, not phillips like the pic showed.

Next, getting the long arm off the celestron.  Front is 1/8" allen, back are two 3/32" allens.

Okay, so now I just need to 3d print a bracket to span that length and fit the dovetail mount of the iOptron.

Tube itself is just under 10#.

# OLD: 

# Dawson's Celestron

Checked out Dawson's Celestron scope for David...the remote isn't working.  Preliminary analysis:
* You can still move the scope via the remote
* The screen is iffy at best...most of the time, you can't get any characters to show up
* Optics, however, are decent

My next steps:  can we either fix or replace the remote, or get the RS-232 connecton on the bottom to work for tracking.

## Further Research
Turns out, you can't buy replacement for this beast.  It's a Nextar8, circa 2000.  Check out this link from cloudy nights:

I tried the ribbon cable repair, cleaning it with electronics cleaner.  No noticable improvement.

Probed the serial connections...pinouts can be found here:

Turns out you'll need to enable RS-232 every time, which means knowing the menu.  A newer menu tree is on this site, but the old menus aren't documented.

Couldn't get the screen on reliably to navigate the menu.
