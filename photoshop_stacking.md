# Glenn's Photoshop Stacking workflow.
So you've got a bunch of images that you want to make into a cool final image.  Here's my stacking workflow:

## Image Selection and Crop
Go through your images and pick the best ones.  I did 8 for jupiter; trying 3 for saturn.

For each of those images, zoom in to 200%, and use the object selection too to grab the planet.  Cut it out, and copy it into your base image.
You are probably going to want to start with a smaller base image as the planet is small...

## Alignment
The first image gets place easy with a simple command-v.

Do the same copy with the second, but then make sure the images are aligned (use the "eye" icon to cycle between the two).  To make adjustments:  use command-t to "transform" the layer, and then move it with the arrow keys.
Repeat for all images.

## Stacking
First, make all images into a smart object by selecting them all, and then right clicking and selecting "convert to smart object".  (You can also do this through the layers menu above).

Next, go to layer->smart object->stack mode and select median.  You can play with the other types too...but I find median works best.

## Curve Adjustments
This part is trial and error.  Bring up the Image->adjustments->curves graph, and play around with matching the line to the actual histogram data.
