These are going to be my "raw photography" running notes...in reverse cron order (latest on top).

# 9-8-20 First experiments: Secondary mirror shadow?
On our first experiements, we got secondary mirror shadow with the moon.  Setup was:
* 10" orion 
* Afocal setup with canon DLSR & cell phone cameras
* 27mm nagler

Later research said to do ISO at 200 or 400 for the moon.  Focus should be at infinity.  Play wth aperature until you get something that looks good.

For the shadow, the best explanation I found was here:

(check out midnight dan's explanation)

Tried during the day with smaller eyepieces...the 17 nagler didn't look like it had the shadow with the phone.  Gotta try it with other eyepieces...
